\title{Map Joint Group Levels to Process-Specific Levels}
\usage{
map_joint_to_proc(joint_fac, proc_fac)
}
\arguments{
\item{joint_fac}{A factor defining the joint grouping (e.g., interaction of multiple processes).}

\item{proc_fac}{A factor defining a single process grouping for the same rows.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length `nlevels(joint_fac)`, where each entry
  is the integer code of the corresponding level in `proc_fac`.
}
\description{
For each level of a joint grouping factor, find the corresponding level
in a process-specific factor.  Returns an integer vector giving, for each
joint level, the index of the first row in which that joint level appears
in the process factor.
}
\examples{
# Suppose joint grouping has 3 levels, and proc grouping repeats those:
joint_fac <- factor(c("A","B","C","A","B","C"))
proc_fac  <- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,3))
map_joint_to_proc(joint_fac, proc_fac)
#> returns c(1, 1, 2)

}
